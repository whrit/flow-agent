# SWE-Bench Official Implementation Complete

## ✅ Implementation Status

We have successfully integrated the official SWE-bench evaluation system with the swarm-bench CLI tool. The implementation is complete and ready for full evaluation runs.

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### 1. Official SWE-bench Integration (`official_integration.py`)
- Connects to HuggingFace datasets API
- Downloads official SWE-bench and SWE-bench-Lite datasets
- Executes claude-flow commands with proper formatting
- Generates predictions.json for leaderboard submission
- Validates submission format

### 2. CLI Integration
- `swarm-bench swe-bench official` - Run official evaluation
- `swarm-bench swe-bench official --limit 10` - Run limited test
- `swarm-bench swe-bench official --validate` - Validate predictions

### 3. Command Format
The system uses the correct claude-flow command format:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "task" --strategy optimization --agents 8 --non-interactive
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "task" --agents 8 --non-interactive
```

### 4. Optimal Configuration
Based on our testing, the optimal configuration is:
- **Mode**: mesh (for complex coordination)
- **Strategy**: optimization (for bug fixes)
- **Agents**: 8 (balanced parallelism)

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Timing
- Each SWE-bench instance: 5-10 minutes
- SWE-bench-Lite (300 instances): ~25-50 hours
- Full SWE-bench (2,294 instances): ~200-400 hours

### Resources
- Requires active claude-flow with API access
- Each instance makes multiple API calls
- Generates git diff patches for each issue

## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Test (1 instance)
```bash
python run_swe_bench_optimized.py --quick
```

### Limited Evaluation (5 instances, ~30 min)
```bash
python run_swe_bench_optimized.py --evaluate
```

### Full SWE-bench-Lite (300 instances, ~25 hours)
```bash
swarm-bench swe-bench official
```

### With Progress Tracking
```bash
swarm-bench swe-bench official --limit 10 | tee swe-bench.log
```

## 📁 Output Files

The system generates:
- `predictions.json` - Submission file for leaderboard
- `evaluation_report_*.json` - Detailed metrics
- Individual patch files for each instance

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Long Runtime**: Full evaluation takes many hours
2. **API Usage**: Each instance uses multiple API calls
3. **Timeout**: Default 10 minutes per instance
4. **Validation**: Always validate before submission

## 🎯 Submission Process

1. Run evaluation:
   ```bash
   swarm-bench swe-bench official --limit 300
   ```

2. Validate predictions:
   ```bash
   swarm-bench swe-bench official --validate
   ```

3. Submit to leaderboard:
   - Go to https://www.swebench.com/submit
   - Upload `predictions.json`

## 📈 Optimization Results

The system has been optimized with:
- Parallel agent execution (8 agents)
- Mesh coordination for complex tasks
- Optimization strategy for bug fixes
- Proper timeout handling
- Efficient prompt engineering

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If patches aren't generating:
1. Verify claude-flow is installed: `npx claude-flow@alpha --version`
2. Check API access is configured
3. Try increasing timeout in config
4. Run with `--limit 1` to test single instance
