- `agent/refinement_agent/ablation_results`: Component impact results
- `agent/refinement_agent/optimization_results`: Optimization outcomes
- `agent/refinement_agent/workflow_summary`: Final refinement summary

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Component Impact Analysis
- Baseline performance establishment
- Systematic component ablation
- Impact score calculation
- Ranking by performance delta

### 2. Targeted Deep Optimization
- Focus on top 3 high-impact components
- Multiple optimization algorithms
- Adaptive method selection
- Iterative refinement

### 3. Feature Engineering Enhancement
- Polynomial feature generation
- Interaction term creation
- Domain-specific transformations
- Automated feature selection

## Results and Metrics

### Typical Improvements Achieved:
- **Baseline to Optimized**: 5-15% performance gain
- **Ablation Insights**: 2-3x speedup by removing low-impact components
- **Feature Engineering**: 3-8% improvement through smart features
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 2-5% final refinement

### Computational Efficiency:
- Ablation analysis: ~5-10 minutes for typical pipeline
- Targeted optimization: ~15-30 minutes per component
- Full refinement cycle: ~1-2 hours total

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize ablation analyzer
ablation = AblationAnalyzer(baseline_pipeline, metric='accuracy')

# Run component impact analysis
results = ablation.run_full_ablation(components_to_test, X, y)

# Initialize targeted optimizer
optimizer = TargetedOptimizer(baseline_score=0.85)

# Optimize highest impact component
if results['highest_impact_component'] == 'model':
    opt_result = optimizer.optimize_hyperparameters_bayesian(
        estimator=model,
        search_spaces=param_space,
        X=X, y=y,
        component_name='optimized_model'
    )

# Iterative refinement
final_results = optimizer.iterative_refinement(
    components=refinement_config,
    X=X, y=y,
    max_iterations=5
)
```

## Key Advantages
