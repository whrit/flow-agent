## Phase: Targeted Component Optimization

### Configured Capabilities:
1. **Feature Engineering** - Advanced feature transformation and creation
2. **Model Optimization** - Hyperparameter tuning and architecture improvements
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Grid search, Bayesian, and evolutionary optimization
4. **Ablation Analysis** - Component impact assessment

### Optimization Methods Available:
- Grid Search
- Bayesian Optimization
- Evolutionary Algorithms

## Refinement Strategy

### 1. Component Impact Analysis
I will perform systematic ablation analysis to identify which pipeline components have the highest impact on performance:

#### Components to Analyze:
- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
  - Scaling methods (StandardScaler vs MinMaxScaler vs RobustScaler)
  - Missing value imputation strategies
  - Outlier detection and handling
  
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Polynomial features
  - Feature interactions
  - Domain-specific feature creation
  - Feature selection methods (RFE, L1 regularization, mutual information)
  
- **Model Architecture**
  - Base model selection (linear, tree-based, neural)
  - Ensemble strategies
  - Model complexity vs performance trade-off
  
- **Hyperparameter Configuration**
  - Learning rates
  - Regularization parameters
  - Tree depths / layers
  - Optimization algorithms

### 2. Iterative Refinement Process

#### Step 1: Baseline Performance Assessment
- Establish current performance metrics
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Document baseline configurations

#### Step 2: Component-wise Ablation
- Remove/modify one component at a time
- Measure performance impact
- Rank components by impact score

#### Step 3: Targeted Deep Optimization
- Focus on top 3 high-impact components
- Apply advanced optimization techniques:
  - Bayesian optimization for continuous hyperparameters
  - Evolutionary algorithms for discrete choices
  - Grid search for exhaustive small spaces

#### Step 4: Feature Engineering Enhancement
- Create interaction features for high-importance variables
- Apply domain-specific transformations
- Implement automated feature selection

#### Step 5: Ensemble Optimization
- Optimize base model diversity
- Tune ensemble weights using cross-validation
- Implement stacking with meta-learner

### 3. Performance Tracking

All refinements will be tracked with:
- Performance delta from baseline
- Computational cost
- Model complexity metrics
- Cross-validation stability

### 4. Coordination Protocol

As per MLE-STAR requirements, I will:
- Store all decisions in memory using `npx claude-flow@alpha memory store`
- Log progress after each major step with hooks
- Share findings with other agents through the memory system
- Maintain full audit trail of optimizations

## Next Steps

1. Create ablation analysis framework
2. Implement component impact measurement
3. Execute targeted optimizations on high-impact components
4. Document and share results through coordination system
