> **🚀 Claude Code Task Tool Integration Update**: Enhanced integration with Claude Code's Task tool for concurrent agent execution. Clear separation between MCP coordination tools and Claude Code's execution capabilities, with comprehensive documentation and examples for parallel agent spawning.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🎯 Claude Code Task Tool Integration
- **Enhanced CLAUDE.md Templates**: Updated initialization templates with clear guidance
  - Explicit instructions that Claude Code's Task tool spawns agents for actual work
  - MCP tools clearly marked as coordination-only, not for execution
  - Step-by-step workflow: Optional MCP setup → Required Task tool execution
  - Comprehensive examples of concurrent agent spawning patterns

- **Improved Swarm Prompts**: Updated swarm command prompts for better clarity
  - Prominent header emphasizing Task tool usage for agent execution
  - Clear visual separation between coordination and execution tools
  - Concrete examples showing ALL agents spawned in ONE message
  - Warning boxes highlighting critical concurrent execution patterns

- **Enhanced Hive Mind Prompts**: Restructured hive-mind spawn prompts
  - Three-step process clearly documented in prompts
  - Step 1: Optional MCP coordination setup
  - Step 2: REQUIRED Claude Code Task tool for agent spawning
  - Step 3: Batch ALL todos in single TodoWrite call (8-10 todos)

#### 📋 Batch Operation Emphasis
- **TodoWrite Batching**: Strong emphasis on batching 5-10+ todos in ONE call
  - Clear examples showing proper todo batching patterns
  - Visual warnings against sequential todo updates
  - Concrete todo examples with priorities and statuses

#### 📚 Documentation Improvements
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
  - ✅ Claude Code handles: Task tool, file operations, code generation, execution
  - ❌ MCP tools handle: Coordination setup, memory, performance tracking only
  - Visual formatting with emojis and boxes for clarity

- **Concrete Code Examples**:
  ```javascript
  // CORRECT Pattern - Single Message
  Task("Researcher", "Analyze patterns...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder", "Implement features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester", "Create tests...", "tester")
  TodoWrite { todos: [8-10 todos ALL in ONE call] }
  ```

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Prompt Generation Updates
- **generateHiveMindPrompt()**: Restructured to emphasize Task tool usage

### 🛠️ Command Documentation Improvements

#### Complete Command File Generation
- **Fixed Init Command**: Now creates ALL 91 command documentation files
  - 10 swarm command files in `.claude/commands/swarm/`
  - 12 hive-mind command files in `.claude/commands/hive-mind/`
  - 5 agents documentation files in `.claude/commands/agents/`
  - All standard command documentation properly organized

- **Enhanced Template Structure**: Updated `enhanced-templates.js`
  - Added complete COMMAND_STRUCTURE with swarm, hive-mind, and agents categories
  - Comprehensive fallback documentation for all missing command files
  - Proper emphasis on Task tool usage in all agent-related docs

### 📁 File Organization Rules
- **Never save to root folder**: All files properly organized in subdirectories
- Clear directory structure guidance in CLAUDE.md
- Proper organization for `/src`, `/tests`, `/docs`, `/config` directories

### 🎯 Key Takeaways for Users

1. **Always use Claude Code's Task tool** to spawn agents that do actual work
2. **MCP tools are ONLY** for coordination setup, not execution
3. **Batch everything**: Spawn ALL agents in ONE message
4. **TodoWrite must batch**: Always include 5-10+ todos in ONE call
5. **Use coordination hooks**: Every agent must use claude-flow hooks
6. **Proper file organization**: Never save files to root directory

This release ensures users understand the critical distinction between:
- **MCP tools**: Coordinate and plan (the "brain")
- **Claude Code Task tool**: Execute and implement (the "hands")
