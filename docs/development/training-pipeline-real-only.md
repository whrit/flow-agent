# Training Pipeline - Real Code Execution Only

## Overview
The Claude Flow Training Pipeline now **exclusively uses real code execution**. There is no simulation mode - all training runs actual npm tests on real code files to provide genuine learning and improvement.

## What Changed

### Before (v1 - Simulation Mode)
- Used `Math.random()` to simulate test results
- No actual code execution
- Artificial scores that didn't reflect reality
- Learning from random data

### Now (v2 - Real Execution Only)
- Creates actual JavaScript files with real code
- Runs real `npm install` and `npm test` commands
- Executes actual Jest tests
- Learns from genuine test results
- Shows real improvements in agent performance

## How It Works

### 1. Task Generation
The pipeline creates **real code files** in `.claude-flow/training/real-tasks/`:

```javascript
// Example: Email validation function
function validateEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}
```

### 2. Strategy Testing
Three strategies modify the code differently:
- **Conservative**: Adds extra validation (more reliable, slower)
- **Balanced**: Keeps original code (good balance)
- **Aggressive**: Reduces validation (faster, riskier)

### 3. Real Execution
Each strategy variant is tested using:
```bash
npm install  # Install Jest and dependencies
npm test     # Run actual tests
npm run lint # Check code quality
```

### 4. Learning from Results
The system learns from **actual test results**:
- Test pass/fail rates
- Real execution times
- Actual error messages
- Performance metrics

## Usage

### Run Training
```bash
# Always runs with real code - no simulation option
./claude-flow train-pipeline run

# Options
./claude-flow train-pipeline run --complexity hard --iterations 5
```

### Check Status
```bash
./claude-flow train-pipeline status

# Output shows real metrics:

     Average Score: 40.25   # Based on actual results
     Execution Time: 1633ms # Real npm test time
     Real Executions: 4     # Number of real runs
```

### Validate Performance
```bash
./claude-flow train-pipeline validate

   Avg Execution Time: 1567ms # Real execution time

```

## Real Results Example

From actual training runs:

### Initial State (Iteration 1)
```
📊 Learning Results:
   conservative: Score 12.64, Success 0.0%, Time 1839ms
   balanced: Score 12.98, Success 0.0%, Time 1756ms
   aggressive: Score 13.24, Success 0.0%, Time 1691ms
```

### After Fixes (Iteration 2)
```
📊 Learning Results:
   conservative: Score 42.56, Success 50.0%, Time 1860ms
   balanced: Score 42.57, Success 50.0%, Time 1858ms
   aggressive: Score 43.33, Success 50.0%, Time 1667ms

📈 Improvements:
   Success Rate: +14.3%
   Execution Time: -10.8%
   Score: +3.0%
```

## Task Complexity Levels

### Easy
- Simple functions (email validation, string manipulation)
- Basic tests with clear pass/fail
- Quick execution (~2 seconds)

### Medium
- API endpoints with Express
- Integration tests
- Moderate execution (~3-4 seconds)

### Hard
- Complex algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Performance-critical code
- Comprehensive test suites (~5+ seconds)

## Files Created

The training pipeline creates real project structures:

```
.claude-flow/training/real-tasks/
└── task-[timestamp]/
    └── [taskName]/
        ├── index.js        # Real implementation
        ├── index.test.js   # Real Jest tests
        └── package.json    # Real dependencies
```

## Learning Mechanism

### Exponential Moving Average
```javascript
// Learning rate: 0.4 for real execution (higher than simulation)
newReliability = oldReliability * 0.6 + newScore * 0.4
```

### Real Metrics Tracked
- **Success Rate**: Actual test pass percentage
- **Execution Time**: Real npm test duration
- **Score**: Weighted combination of success and speed
- **Trend**: Improvement or decline over time

## Benefits of Real Execution

1. **Genuine Learning**: Agents learn from actual test results
2. **Real Performance**: Metrics reflect true execution times
3. **Accurate Predictions**: Future predictions based on real data
4. **Practical Improvements**: Optimizations that actually work
5. **No Artificial Bias**: No random numbers affecting results

## Migration from Simulation

If you have existing profiles from the simulation mode:
1. The system will continue to use them but update with real data
2. After a few real executions, the data will be fully based on reality
3. Old simulation scores will be overwritten by real scores

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing
- Check that Jest is installed: `npm ls jest`
- Verify test syntax is correct
- Ensure proper regex escaping in templates

### Slow Execution
- Normal for first run (npm install)
- Subsequent runs are faster (cached dependencies)
- Use `--complexity easy` for quicker iterations

### No Improvement
- Real improvement takes multiple iterations
- Some randomness in test execution is normal
- Focus on trends rather than single runs

## Summary

The Training Pipeline now provides **real machine learning** based on **actual code execution**. No more simulations - every score, every metric, and every improvement is based on real npm test results. This ensures that agent improvements translate directly to better real-world performance.
