## Architectural Considerations

### Design Principles

**1. Unified Provider Interface**
- Both Claude Code and Codex implement same `ILLMProvider` interface
- Enables transparent provider switching
- Simplifies testing and maintenance

**2. Event Translation Layer**
- Isolates Codex-specific logic from core provider
- Makes event mappings independently testable
- Easy to update as Codex SDK evolves

**3. Thread Session Mapping**
- Maps agent sessions to Codex threads (1:1)
- Enables conversation continuity
- Supports session persistence and resumption

**4. Provider-Agnostic Swarm Coordination**
- No changes required to swarm orchestration
- Mixed-provider swarms work seamlessly
- Failover between providers automatic

### Technical Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Swarm Orchestrator               │
│    (Provider-Agnostic)              │
└────────┬────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ├─→ Claude Code Provider ✅
         ├─→ Codex Provider ❌ (to implement)
         ├─→ OpenAI Provider ✅
         └─→ Google Provider ✅

         ↓ All use

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Unified Message Bus              │
│    (LLMStreamEvent interface)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Codex Adaptations

**Thread Management** (Unique to Codex)
- Codex uses persistent threads vs stateless messages
- Requires session-to-thread ID mapping
- Thread resumption for conversation continuity

**Event Streaming** (Codex-Specific)
- Codex uses JSONL streaming
- Requires translation to unified `LLMStreamEvent` format
- 8 event types must be mapped

**Sandbox Configuration** (Codex-Specific)
- Codex has sandbox modes (read-only, workspace-write, full-access)
- Working directory configuration
- Git repository trust levels
