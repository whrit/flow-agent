# Codex CLI Integration Blueprint

## Desired Outcome
- Ship first-class `codex-cli` support in claude-flow so agents can execute either Claude Code or Codex powered workflows interchangeably.
- Provide configuration, CLI affordances, orchestration hooks, and persistence so Codex threads, streamed events, and resulting file/system changes flow through the same abstractions used today (providers, swarm bus, memory, monitoring, CLI UI).
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing Anthropic-focused paths while making it obvious how to extend to additional agent runtimes in the future.

## Existing Assets & Entry Points
- **Vendored SDK**: `codex-typescript-sdk/` contains the upstream TypeScript SDK that shells out to the Rust `codex` binary and surfaces JSONL events (`thread.started`, `item.*`, etc.).
- **Provider abstraction**: `src/providers/*`, `src/providers/provider-manager.ts`, and `src/providers/types.ts` define the unified LLM interface used across claude-flow.
- **Agent orchestration**: `src/agents/**`, `src/swarm/**`, `src/communication/message-bus.ts`, and `src/sdk/session-forking.ts` orchestrate agent execution and streaming events.
- **CLI entry points**: `src/cli/main.ts`, command modules under `src/cli/commands/`, and helpers in `src/cli/utils/` cover user interaction.
- **Configuration & secrets**: `src/config/config-manager.ts`, `.claude/settings.json`, and environment bindings manage provider selection and API credentials.
- **Testing scaffolding**: Jest configuration (`jest.config.js`, `tests/**`, `src/__tests__/**`) plus CLI smoke scripts in `scripts/test-comprehensive.js`.

## High-Level Work Breakdown

### 1. Workspace & SDK Packaging
- [ ] Depend on the published `@openai/codex-sdk` npm package (pin the version, add change management via Dependabot), and remove the temporary `codex-typescript-sdk/` copy once parity is confirmed.
- [ ] Verify the installed package bundles the correct platform-specific `codex` binary (macOS aarch64/x86, Linux, Windows) and document any runtime prerequisites (e.g., API key env vars, optional binary overrides).
- [ ] Add build/test scripts so CI verifies the SDK (e.g., `npm run test:codex-sdk`) without bloating claude-flow pipelines.
- [ ] Gate binary download/build behind explicit approval (respect existing sandbox/approval policies); ensure the approval script (for example, `npm run approve-builds`) is updated so Codex binaries can run when needed.

### 2. Provider Abstraction & SDK Hook
- [ ] Extend `src/providers/types.ts` to recognize a new provider key (`'codex'`) and enrich `LLMModel` (e.g., `codex-mini`, `codex-standard` if applicable).
- [ ] Implement `src/providers/codex-provider.ts` that extends `BaseProvider` but delegates completion/streaming to Codex threads via the SDK. Responsibilities:
  - Instantiate `new Codex({ baseUrl, apiKey, codexPathOverride })`.
  - On non-streaming requests, call `thread.run(prompt)` and translate `RunResult` into the generic `LLMResponse` structure (map usage tokens, cost estimates if available, and final text).
  - On streaming requests, use `thread.runStreamed()` and convert emitted `ThreadEvent` objects into `LLMStreamEvent` deltas.
  - Handle reconnection/resume by caching `thread.id` between turns when the provider is reused.
- [ ] Rely on the published type definitions (`node_modules/@openai/codex-sdk/dist/index.d.ts`) as the canonical JSONL schema; they include the full `ThreadEvent`/`ThreadItem` unions we need for translation.
- [ ] Register the provider inside `ProviderManager.createProvider()` and allow configuration (API key, default model, sandbox mode, working directory) to flow through the existing provider config schema.
- [ ] Update `src/providers/provider-manager.ts` to support fallback or load-balancing logic that now includes Codex (e.g., codex-as-primary, Claude as fallback).

### 3. Event Translation & Message Bus Integration
- [ ] Create `src/integration/codex/event-translator.ts` (or similar) that maps Codex `ThreadEvent` payloads to claude-flow internal events:

| Codex Event / Item Type | Expected claude-flow Event | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thread.started` | `swarm.created` / custom `agent.started` event with `threadId` | `SwarmCoordinator.emitSwarmEvent` |
| `turn.started` | `task.started` for the active agent task | `SwarmExecutor` |
| `item.completed` + `agent_message` | Convert to `LLMStreamEvent` `content` delta and `agent.output` payload | Message bus, CLI renderer |
| `item.completed` + `reasoning` | Emit `agent.telemetry` or attach to `AgentState` reasoning log | `memory/distributed-memory` |
| `item.completed` + `command_execution` | Wrap in a `task.execution` event and surface stdout/stderr to CLI | Command monitor |
| `item.completed` + `file_change` | Generate `task.completed` patch events and send to file mutation subsystem | Apply patch pipeline |
| `item.completed` + `mcp_tool_call` | Mirror to existing MCP client events (`src/mcp/**`) | MCP bridge |
| `turn.completed` | `task.completed` with usage metrics | Agent manager |
| `turn.failed` / `error` | `agent.error` with Codex error message | Logging & retries |

- [ ] Ensure translation emits correlation IDs so `SwarmCoordinator.filterEvents()` can link codex activity to the initiating agent/task.
- [ ] Update any CLI live views (`src/cli/ui/**`, `simple-orchestrator.ts`) to recognize new event payloads (command output, to-do list updates) and render them without breaking existing Claude output handling.

### 4. Agent Lifecycle & Swarm Orchestration
- [ ] Introduce a `CodexAgentRuntime` (e.g., `src/agents/runtimes/codex-runtime.ts`) that wraps the SDK and exposes spawn/heartbeat/shutdown semantics expected by `AgentManager`.
- [ ] Extend `AgentManager.initialize()` (`src/agents/agent-manager.ts`) to register codex-capable templates (coder, fixer, benchmark agents) and specify runtime metadata (`environmentDefaults.runtime = 'codex'`).
- [ ] When session forking (`src/sdk/session-forking.ts`) or query control (`src/sdk/query-control.ts`), detect codex threads and delegate to complementary Codex APIs (document that pause/resume semantics may differ).
- [ ] Update swarm execution paths (`src/swarm/executor*.ts`, `src/swarm/coordinator.ts`) to dispatch tasks to codex agents when the provider is configured, including sandbox flags and working directory routing.

### 5. CLI & UX Changes
- [ ] Add CLI flags to select the provider (e.g., `claude-flow start --provider codex`, `claude-flow agent spawn --runtime codex`). Wire them into command handlers (`src/cli/commands/start.ts`, `agent.ts`, etc.).
- [ ] Introduce a dedicated `codex` command mirroring `claude` in `src/cli/commands/codex.ts` if a direct Codex CLI surface is desired (allows advanced users to interact with codex threads without going through higher-level orchestration).
- [ ] Modify `src/cli/help*.ts` and `README.md` CLI usage sections to highlight Codex availability and provider selection.
- [ ] Ensure the REPL (`src/cli/repl.ts`) and simple CLI flows (`src/cli/simple-cli.ts`) can stream Codex output, including progress indicators for MCP/tool actions.

### 6. Configuration, Secrets & Sandbox Awareness
- [ ] Extend `ConfigManager` (`src/config/config-manager.ts`) schema to include `codex` provider defaults (API key env var `CODEX_API_KEY`, base URL override, default model, sandbox mode).
- [ ] Update `.claude/settings.json` schema and any config templates (`docs`, `examples`) so the provider can be switched without manual edits.
- [ ] Reflect sandbox requirements by propagating `ApprovalMode` and `SandboxMode` from CLI arguments to Codex `ThreadOptions` (ensuring they align with the harness environment context provided in the repo).
- [ ] Document environment variable precedence (`CODEX_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, local binary overrides) in the new docs.

### 7. Persistence & Session Management
- [ ] Decide on storage for Codex `thread.id` and historical events. Options: augment `memory/` persistence or create a new store under `memory/codex/`.
- [ ] Ensure thread resumption works after process restarts by capturing `thread.started` events in durable storage and rehydrating them in `AgentManager`.
- [ ] Harmonize logs, metrics, and transcripts so `analysis-reports/` or `docs/reporting` flows show Codex runs alongside Claude runs.

### 8. Tooling, File Operations & Safety
- [ ] Implement a file patch applicator that consumes Codex `file_change` items and translates them into the existing apply/verify workflow (consider leveraging `scripts/test-comprehensive.js --load --npx` patch validation).
- [ ] When Codex emits `command_execution` items, route them through the sandbox enforcement already used for internal commands so no unapproved shell escapes occur.
- [ ] Map Codex to-do updates to the swarm planner so other agents can react (e.g., convert to `task.created` events).
- [ ] Validate MCP tool interactions by integrating Codex `mcp_tool_call` events with `src/mcp-client` (if available) to trigger or mirror tool execution.

### 9. Observability & Metrics
- [ ] Expand provider metrics (`ProviderManager.updateProviderMetrics`) to record Codex-specific usage (execution time, number of files touched, command exit codes).
- [ ] Hook into monitoring dashboards (`src/monitoring/**`) so the health check (`scripts/health-check`) includes Codex connectivity (binary presence, API auth).
- [ ] Emit structured logs when Codex threads start/complete (include thread ID, sandbox mode, working directory) for easier debugging.

### 10. Testing & Quality Gates
- [ ] Unit tests:
  - Mock the Codex SDK (`codex-typescript-sdk/tests/codexExecSpy.ts` shows how to stub `spawn`) to verify provider translation logic.
  - Cover event translation mapping in isolation.
  - Ensure configuration parsing picks up Codex-specific fields.
- [ ] Integration tests:
  - Add `tests/integration/codex-provider.test.ts` covering basic prompt â†’ response, streaming, file change translation (use mocked JSONL fixtures stored under `tests/fixtures/codex/*.jsonl`).
  - Update existing CLI smoke tests to run with `--provider codex` (possibly behind a feature flag until the binary is available in CI).
- [ ] End-to-end:
  - Provide optional manual script (`scripts/run-codex-demo.ts`) that requires a real Codex binary/API key but can be executed locally before release.
  - Record golden transcripts for comparison to detect regressions in event handling.
- [ ] CI updates:
  - Add matrix jobs or feature flags so Codex coverage can be toggled without blocking existing pipelines if the binary is unavailable.

### 11. Documentation & Rollout
- [ ] Produce contributor docs in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/codex-getting-started.md`) covering installation, environment variables, sandbox expectations, and troubleshooting.
- [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` to reference Codex-specific workflows (provider selection, new commands).
- [ ] Refresh `README.md` badges and quickstart examples to show `claude-flow --provider codex`.
- [ ] Communicate breaking or notable changes via `CHANGELOG.md` under the upcoming release entry.

## Risk Log & Mitigations
- **Binary distribution size**: Codex vendors platform-specific binaries (~80 MB). Mitigate by documenting caching and ensuring builds strip unnecessary binaries.
- **Sandbox alignment**: Codex supports `sandboxMode` but repo harness uses approval policies; ensure mismatches donâ€™t leave agents blocked. Provide fallbacks (manual sandbox enforcement in claude-flow).
- **Event schema drift**: Codex CLI may evolve; keep `codex-typescript-sdk` synced with upstream tags and run contract tests that diff events against fixtures.
- **Token/cost tracking**: Codex events may not supply usage totals; design estimation fallbacks or accept null usage until upstream support arrives.
- **Tool execution parity**: MCP/tool events must not double-execute when both Codex and claude-flow attempt the same action; design single source of truth for tool invocation routing.

## Sequencing & Dependencies
1. Complete workspace packaging + provider scaffolding (Tracks 1 & 2).  
2. Implement event translation and integrate with message bus (Track 3) before CLI/agent updates.  
3. Once runtime path is wired, retrofit CLI/config support (Tracks 4â€“6).  
4. Finalize persistence, tooling, observability (Tracks 7â€“9).  
5. Land tests, docs, and changelog updates (Tracks 10â€“11).  
6. Schedule limited beta rollout with feature flag or config opt-in before enabling by default.

## Decisions
- Default provider switches to Codex whenever the SDK/binary is detected; fall back to Anthropic otherwise.
- Provider-level branching remains (no higher-level agent runtime abstraction for this integration).
- When Codex is active, the CLI auto-detects it on startup and prints a banner (`Using Codex runtimeâ€¦ Use --provider anthropic to switch back.`) to highlight Codex-only features without introducing additional flags.

## Open Questions
- TBD as implementation progresses; update this section when new uncertainties surface.

Keep this blueprint updated as implementation progressesâ€”mark checkboxes, link PRs, and append lessons learned so future provider integrations benefit from the same scaffolding.
